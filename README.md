# poivre

poivre (French for pepper) is an application that attempts to solve, or at least
facilitate, issues related to organizing meals taking into account each person's
tastes and dietary or cultural limitations.

Users can create profiles and, over time, add their preferences iteratively,
eventually building a comprehensive description of their tastes without
overwhelming questionnaires. Also, **events** can be set up with invitations to
users, based on which the organizer can generate reports from the profiles of
all the attendees.

Considering the cultural importance of food, poivre takes into considering the
different representations each ingredient, dish or term can take within
different contexts and languages.

A great example for this is *curry*. Notoriously originating from the Indian
subcontinent, the word can describe an entire range of dishes, usually stew-like
and containing *several* spices, and also describes somewhat related dishes in
other cultures, such as Thai green curries and Japanese katsu kare. However, in
Brazilian Portuguese, *curry* largely means a spice blend which, while
ultimately related to the former meaning, is a different category of foodstuff
altogether, and more importantly, is used differently and has a discrete
*cultural meaning*.

## Software Engineering?

While poivre is meant as a real application, in the context of its development
as the basis for my final undergraduate studies project, it is also meant to
serve as a case study for the development of web applications using an
unorthodox technology stack, that is, moving away from such elements as
Javascript and traditional relational DBMSs.

More information will be made available after the project itself is evaluated.
